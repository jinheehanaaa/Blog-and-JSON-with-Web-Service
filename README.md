# Objective 2
- fetch (by id) for lightweight rendering (fetch)
- Test (Dart's function test)
- Integration test (Flutter's widget test)
- ScrollVIew
- JSON (string to json object for location)
- - We need to decode (or deserialize) data coming from server
- map (data with unique key)

# Demo
- decoded JSON from [Flutter Crash Course](https://fluttercrashcourse.com/courses/basics).
- [YouTube](https://youtu.be/On4kEM6yGr8)

# Tip
- If you want offline mode (not using json from web service), go to [002 - Sanity Checks with Integration Tests](https://github.com/jinheehanaaa/flutter-blog-and-json-from-web-service/tree/cb65b91bb7d36b1529329fdfbccc6469c34e0571)
- - But you're app size will be limited

# CMD
- Run this code for generate g.dart files: <code>flutter packages pub run build_runner build</code> for using json package
- Run this code for overwrite: <code>flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs</code>
